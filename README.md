# Google Analytics

Simply put, Google Analytics is an analytics tool that can be used to track and analyze actions on a website, such as the number of visitors, number of page views, and the site’s bounce rate. It is free to use by any webmaster. However, there is a paid version – and I should add it is a bit expensive for small businesses and publishers – with some advanced features.

While all data is anonymized on it, you can easily understand user behavior and traffic flow of the site alongside traffic sources to understand where visitors to your sites come from.

It has made both Android and iOS apps to see the reports on the go, and Google Analytics is one of the few tools on the market that can report live visitors on the site. You can even see from which city a visitor is.

## How does it work?

The core technologies for Google Analytics are Cookies and tracking codes. Just like most modern analytics tools, it uses tracking codes to see and measure web performance. After signing up for the service, you have to create a new property. Once you have done that, the web interface provides you with a code. This little JavaScript code snippet has to be added to every page of the site you want to track.

Now, this sounds like a terrifying task for a site with thousands of pages, but in most CMS, you can find plugins to add the code or, in many cases, add the code to a common header file of the site to get the job done.

Once you are done with this, you should be good to do. Next, you can create custom dashboards on the Google Analytics Web Interface to see and monitor your care about stats. It can be a little confusing at first, but you will be comfortable enough to create custom dashboards and export custom reports with the time you will be comfortable enough.

Aside from tracking page views and bounce rates, Google Analytics has support for event tracking. You can use it to see how many people clicked on the sign-up button, for example.
